# LB Portfolio

A WordPress plugin for a portfolio using OOP.

The portfolio used WordPress custom posts and taxonomies.

The taxonomies allow the different projects to be put into different categories.

There is a widget to display the categories in the sidebar.

The finished project can be seen at: https://lucy-barker.co.uk/
